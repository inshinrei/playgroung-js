## usage

1. set the container `.setContainer(element)`
2. invoke logging `.e, .i, .w`

## plan

1. implement container set and render a list in there
2. implement list logging
3. implement animation for text appearing (under media query)
4. implement animation for list appearing and disappearing (under media query)
5. make set container and logger options as an invokable builder, so that multiple lists could be set
6. optimize DOM insertions
